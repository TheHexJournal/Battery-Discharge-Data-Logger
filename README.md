# Battery Discharge Data Logger
This repository contains the source code for a data logger which logs battery voltage and current during discharge.<br> 
The source code for both the MCU (server) and computer (client) are available in the MCU and PC folder respectively.<br>
The .ino file in the MCU folder can be uploaded to the MCU using Arduino IDE. <br>
The logger on the client can be compiled by using `make`. An executable named `logger` should be then be available at the root of the repository.<br>
The source code has not been tested on any OS other than Ubuntu. <br>
Details of the project can be found [here](). <br>
